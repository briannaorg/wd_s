## New and improved wd_s with scaffolding
=============

Roll up a new WordPress theme in no time by answering a few questions, using grunt-init.

Clone this repo into ~/.grunt-init/ or %USERPROFILE%\.grunt-init\ for Windows users.

To create a new project using a grunt-init template just run the following command in the root of your project directory:

	$ grunt-init {template name}
	
Afterwards you just need to run npm install and the plugins defined in the package.json will be installed.

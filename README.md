## New and improved wd_s with scaffolding
=============

Roll up a new WordPress theme in no time by answering a few questions, using grunt-init.

Clone this repo into ~/.grunt-init/ or %USERPROFILE%\.grunt-init\ for Windows users.

To create a new project using a grunt-init template just run the following command in the root of your project directory:

	$ grunt-init {template name}
	
Answer the questions at the prompt (or hit enter to leave the defaults).	
	
Afterwards you just need to run npm install and the plugins defined in the package.json will be installed.
